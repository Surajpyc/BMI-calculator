# BMI Calculator

This is a simple Python script to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight.

## How It Works

- The program asks the user to enter their height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms).
- It then calculates the BMI using the formula:

  ```
  BMI = weight / heightÂ²
  ```

- Based on the BMI value, it categorizes the user into one of the following categories:
  - **Underweight** (BMI < 18.5)
  - **Normal** (18.5 <= BMI < 25)
  - **Overweight** (25 <= BMI < 30)
  - **Obese** (BMI >= 30)

- The user is given recommendations based on their BMI category.
- The script loops if the user wants to check their BMI again.

## Example Output

```
Enter your height in meters: 1.75
Enter your weight in kilograms: 70
Your BMI is 22.86
Your BMI is normal
Constant consumption of same amount of calories
Keep doing minimal exercise
Do you want to check BMI [Yes/No]:
```

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Save the code in a file named `bmi_calculator.py`.
3. Run the script using the terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python bmi_calculator.py
   ```
